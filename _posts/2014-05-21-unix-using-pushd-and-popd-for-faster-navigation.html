<p>The <strong>pushd</strong> and <strong>popd</strong> commands put directory paths onto a directory stack (<strong>pushd</strong>) and then pop them off again (<strong>popd</strong>). Using the pushd and popd commands is not unlike dropping directory "bread crumbs" and then returning in reverse order to all the places you visited.</p>
