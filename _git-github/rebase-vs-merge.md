## Rebasing vs. Merging
Merging combine branches, you go to different paths and join back in the main road.
Rebasing adds branches on top of other branches. You go to a different path, and then come back and add the whole path on top of the main road.

Rebasing is neat, but you kinda lose the original commit authors.
