Notes

- You can only use Azure DevOps if the source repo is at Github or Azure DevOps (both Microsoft owned)
- How much do repos on Azure DevOps cost? Bitbucket costs us $28 for 8 users. That's $3/user/month. Cheaper than Github. Azure Repos is free for first 5 users and then $6 per additional user. 8 users would cost us $18/month.
