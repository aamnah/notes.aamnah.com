title: 14 days of DevOps
date: 2020-03-17

### Background

- I have already setup CI/CD for a React Native project, it uses Bitbucket Pipelines and deploys to different release channels on Expo
- I have already setup CD for a .NET Corde project that deploys to AWS Elastic Beanstalk (EBS)

I'm not entirely new to DevOps, and i'm entirely self-taught. Google and SlackOverflow are my best friends

DevOps goals

- Fast time-to-market (TTM)
- Few production failures
- Immediate recovery from failures

Automation leads to consistency and stability - code is built, tested and deployed the same way every time
