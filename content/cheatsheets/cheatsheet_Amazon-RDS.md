### NOTES

- If can not connect, check if the port is open on the server you are connecting from. RDS uses `3306` (default MySQL port). On KH server it couldn’t connect because the port was closed
- If the connection is not getting through the error would be `could not connect`
- If login is incorrect the error would be `‘access denied’. mysql_connect(): Access denied for user`
- The user you are connecting with needs to be created at RDS. It doesn’t matter if the server you are connecting from has it or not

### Opening Ports

Make sure ports are opened in the firewall configuration.

This can be accessed in _WHM >> Plugins » ConfigServer Security &amp; Firewall >> Firewall configuration >> Port settings_.
