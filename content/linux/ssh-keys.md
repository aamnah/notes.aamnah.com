- Generate a key pair locally
- Give the public key to the remote server
- Keep the private key yourself

## Generate key

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```
Previously, i used to use `rsa` as the type, but i have since moved on to `ed25519`. Ed25519 is a newer public-key algorithm which is faster (and safer) than RSA. Ed25519 public-key is also more compact, containing only 68 characters as compared to RSA 3072 that has 544 characters. Ed25519 is supported by OpenSSH so you should be good in almost all cases. 

Github recommends passing it your email with -C which is then uses as a label.

```bash
cd ~/.ssh && ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "hello@example.com"
```

## Copy .pub file to remote

```bash
scp id_ed25519.pub user@remoteserver:location
```

On linux you can do 

```bash
ssh-copy-id user@123.456.789.123

# ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/mykey -p 1234 user@host
```

## Permissions
The remote server doesn't like the authorizated_keys file having too many permissions. For better security, change the authorizated_keys file to `600` and the _ssh_ folder to `700`. The permissions on `.ssh` can not be any higher than 755. 

```bash
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
```

You might even have to change permissions for the `/home` directory

```bash
chmod go-w ~/
```

## sshd_config
The config file for the ssh daemon is at:

```
/etc/ssh/sshd_config
```

You can also use the `find` command to find the file location:

```bash
find / -name sshd_config
```

Make a copy of the config file if you are afraid of messing it up

```bash
cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.bak
```

## Restart SSH

```bash
service sshd restart
```

If you don't know what the service name for ssh is, you can list all of the services to find out:

```bash
service --status-all
```

## .ssh/config (local system)

You can create an SSH config file at `~/.ssh/config` and save all your SSH connection settings there. You will then be able to run `ssh FOO` and connect with all the settings defined for the host _FOO_.

```bash
# My settings for connecting to FOO server
Host foo
  #HostName www.myfooserver.com
  HostName 123.456.789.123
  User USERNAME
  Port 22
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/MY_SSH_KEY
```


## Start the `ssh-agent` and load your keys
See if ssh-agent is running:

```bash
ps -e | grep [s]sh-agent
```
 
Run ssh-agent:

```bash
ssh-agent /bin/bash
```

OR

```bash
ssh-agent bash
```

OR 

```bash
eval $(ssh-agent)
```

Load ssh key:

```bash
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519 
```

List loaded ssh keys:

```bash
ssh-add -l
```

## Copy key to clipboard
Copy your key to your clipboard with (Linux only): 

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub | pbcopy
```

## Troubleshhoting
Simple as that. Though troubleshooting might be needed.

- make sure the .pub key has been copied to the `authorized_keys` file, on remote server, in the `~/.ssh` folder. If it doesn't exist, create one.
- make sure that the path you copied to is the path specifies in the ssh config file. The ssh config file is at: `sshd_config
- if the error doesn't make sense try ssh with verbose mode `-v`.
- make sure you have no extra white space at the end when you copy the key, because that can throw it in a loop.
