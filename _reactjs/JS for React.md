# JS for React
React is just JavaScript. If you're getting frustrated with React, it's probably because your JS knowledge is lacking. For example `.map()` is very good for generating HTML lists in React. But if you don't know the JS `.map()` method, you'll wonder what happened.

- .map()
- .bind(this)
