update 2020-04-30

- The domain is being changed from http://tldrdevnotes.com to http://notes.aamnah.com. Will eventually become aamnah.com/notes (for SEO reasons)
- The site maybe migrated from Hugo to WordPress or Gatsby

---

## Current State
In it's current state the site/project serves as my diary for all web development, system administration and web design notes. There may be some personal posts, but they are not meant to be public.

The site was originally built using Jekyll, but Jekyll turned into a slow hell when the posts turned into hundreds and the build times turned to 5-10mins. Hugo came to the rescue, super fast build times. But switching meant learning another syntax and setup, which slowed down the launch time. In the meantime, i kept adding notes, but they didn't show up online because the new site was never launched. Up until now.

Gatsby is another site generator that might be the next step for TLDRDevNotes.com

## Theme
The theme used is built from scratch, following this nice [Youtube series by Giraffe Academy]() and reading online documentation. 

The name of the theme being used is `tldr` and the path is `./themes/tldr`

## Static assets

- Images directory is `./static/img/`
- Use `/img/` before the file name when referencing the image in files.

## Developing the site

```bash
brew install hugo
hugo server -D --disableFastRender # -D, --buildDrafts, include content marked as draft
```
